          <p>In this project I created an arcade version of Metal Gear Solid.The main
          goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible and in the end you come
          face to face with the boss that you have to defeat in order to win.In your way
        towards victory you come across different types of villains and power-ups</p>

          <h3>Pizza delivery system (C)</h3>
          <img src= "../../images/pizza_guy.png" height="130" width="120" alt="Computer pic" class = "circle"/>
          <p>This is a simulation of a pizza delivery system using threads in C.
          Each thread is responsible for a different job such as registering the orders,baking the pizza,delivering the pizza,etc.
          Each resource(bakers,delivery staff,ovens) is represented by a mutex.
